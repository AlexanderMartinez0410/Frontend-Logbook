## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I learned the importance of using CSS custom properties (variables) for better maintainability and consistency in styling. By defining variables for colors, fonts, and other design tokens, I can easily update the theme across the entire stylesheet without repetitive code.

```css
:root {
    --primary-background: hsl(0, 0%, 8%);
    --card-background: hsl(0, 0%, 12%);
    /* ... */
}
```

This approach makes the code more professional and easier to manage.

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on responsive design techniques and accessibility features in future projects. Additionally, exploring CSS Grid for more complex layouts would be beneficial.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs on CSS Custom Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*) - Helped me understand how to use CSS variables effectively.
- [Frontend Mentor Community](https://www.frontendmentor.io/community) - Great for getting feedback and inspiration from other developers.

### AI Collaboration

I used GitHub Copilot only to make the class names more professional.
